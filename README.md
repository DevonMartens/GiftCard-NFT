# About Project

This is a gamified gift Card NFT app.

It is set up so that if a user tries to spend tokens but doesn't have the gift card or doesnt send the gift card with a sale the new holder can come claim.

Will eventually be tied to a betting game of sorts. 


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
